FEA Simulation Result Prediction using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) : 

• Objective : To address the relies of traditional finite element analysis on commercial simulation software that is
  Computationally expensive and time-intensive.
  
• Approach : Developed PINN models to directly predict the deformation of the CAD, reducing dependency on   commercial solvers while delivering acceptable results through a hybrid data-driven and physics-based approach
